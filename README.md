**Focus Areas:**
1. **Data Quality** – Examples and assessment of structured and unstructured data issues.  
2. **Yield Curve Modeling** – Nelson-Siegel & Cubic-Spline fitting, parameter interpretation, and ethics of smoothing.  
3. **Exploiting Correlation** – PCA on simulated vs real government bond yields, screeplot comparisons.  
4. **Empirical ETF Analysis** – Returns, covariance, PCA, and SVD on sector ETF data with 500+ word interpretation.
